# Data Cleaning and Transformation Using Power Query/Excel
Data Cleaning and Transformation

In this project, I have utilized a [Fifa 2021 dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cameronriley/2021-fifa-dataset#Import-and-Clean-Dataset), which is raw and unorganized. My primary objective is to enhance my Power Query skills in Excel by performing data cleaning, a crucial step in data analysis.

Here are the steps I followed to clean the data:

- I promoted the first row as the header.
- I removed special characters and unnecessary suffixes from the respective columns.
- I changed the data types of several columns from Text to their appropriate integers or decimals.
- I standardized the height column, which had a mixture of centimeters, inches, and feet, to contain only centimeter values.
- I separated the "joined" date column into individual columns for Year, Month, and Day.
- I converted the "value," "wage," and "release clause" columns from strings to numeric data types.

The data is now appropriately prepared for the next step: data analysis.
